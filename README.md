# XRPL-CORE-FUNCTIONS
Core Functions include a set of essential functionalities that form the backbone of the XRP Ledger's , which serves as implementation for VIHOLDER

Transaction Processing: The core functions handle the validation and processing of transactions on the XRP Ledger. Transactions can involve payments, account settings changes, or other operations supported by the ledger.

Ledger Management: The core functions are responsible for maintaining and updating the ledger's state, which includes information about the account balances, transaction history, and other ledger data.

Cryptography and Security: The XRP Ledger utilizes cryptographic techniques for securing transactions and maintaining the integrity of the ledger. Core functions handle cryptographic operations like digital signatures and hash functions.

Network Communication: Core functions manage the communication between nodes in the XRP Ledger network. Nodes exchange transaction and ledger data to stay synchronized.

Fee Calculation: The XRP Ledger uses a unique fee mechanism called "transaction cost" to prevent network spam and ensure a stable network. Core functions calculate the transaction fees based on the ledger load.

Pathfinding and Payment Routing: Core functions facilitate payment pathfinding, which helps in finding the most efficient route for payment transactions across the XRP Ledger's network of accounts and liquidity providers.

Escrow and Smart Contracts: The XRP Ledger supports advanced features like escrow and optional "checks" that enable conditional payments. Core functions handle the execution and validation of these features.

Account Management: Core functions deal with account creation, activation, and account-specific settings like account reserves and trust lines.
